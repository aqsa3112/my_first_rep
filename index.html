        <h2>Block-level Elements</h2>
        <p>A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

            A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
            
            Two commonly used block elements are: &lt; p &gt; and &lt;div&gt; 
            <ol>
                <li> The &lt; p &gt;element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.</li>
                <li> The &lt; div &gt; element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.</li>
            </ol>
           
            
           </p>
           <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
           <p>An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
            <br><b>e.g</b>
            <ol>
                <li>&lt; a &gt;</li>
                <li>&lt; b &gt;</li>
                <li>&lt; br &gt;</li>
                <li>&lt; img &gt;</li>
                <li>&lt; big &gt;</li>
                <li>&lt; small &gt;</li>
            </ol>
           </p>
           <h2>What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?</h2>
           <p>Both HTML and HTML5 are hypertext markup languages, primarily used to develop web pages or applications. HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and supports new markup language functionalities such as multimedia, new tags and elements as well as new APIs.
            <br>
            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>HTML does not provide native audio and video support.</li>
                <li>HTML doesnâ€™t allow users to draw shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles.</li>
                <li>HTML only uses browser cache and cookies to store data temporarily. </li>

                <li>HTML5 allows users to draw shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles</li>
                <li>HTML5 uses web SQL databases, local storage, and application cache for storing data temporarily. </li>

           <h2>What is favicon and how can we use it?</h2>
           <p>A favicon is a small icon associated with a website that appears in the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks. It helps users identify and distinguish websites easily. To use a favicon, create a square image (usually 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels) and save it as a .ico file. Place the file in the root directory of your website, and browsers will automatically display it. You can also use a link tag in the HTML head to specify the favicon's location:<br> &lt;link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon" &gt;</p>
          <h2>What is relative path and absolute path in html?</h2>
          <p>In HTML, a relative path and an absolute path are ways to specify the location of a resource, such as an image or a linked page.<br>

            Relative Path: A relative path specifies the location of a file or resource in relation to the current location. For example, if your HTML file is in a folder called "images," and you want to link to an image in the same folder, the relative path would be just the image filename (e.g., image.jpg). If the image is in a subfolder named "photos," the relative path would be photos/image.jpg.<br>
            
            Absolute Path: An absolute path provides the full URL or directory structure from the root of the file system or website. It includes the protocol (like http:// or https://), domain, and the full path to the resource. For example, https://example.com/images/image.jpg is an absolute path to an image on a website.</p>
            <h2>What is html attributes?</h2>
            <p>HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
                <ul typr="circles">
                    <li>All HTML elements can have attributes</li>
                    <li>Attributes provide additional information about elements</li>
                    <li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag</li>
                    <li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</li>
                </ul>
                The &lt; a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:<br>
                &lt;a href="https://www.w3schools.com"&gt;Visit W3Schools&lt;/a&gt;
            </p>
            <h2>How title attribute works?</h2>
            <p>The title attribute in HTML is used to provide additional information about an element, typically when a user hovers over that element. It's commonly used with elements like &lt; a&gt;  (anchor tags), &lt; img&gt; (image tags), and others.<br>
                &lt;a href="https://www.example.com" title="Visit Example"&gt; Click me&lt;/a&gt; <br>
                The href attribute specifies the link's destination.
                The title attribute provides additional information that is displayed as a tooltip when the user hovers over the link.<br>
                So, when a user hovers over the "Click me" link, a small box containing the text "Visit Example" will appear, offering extra context or details related to the link. This is particularly useful for improving accessibility and user experience by giving users more information about the purpose or content of a link.</p>
            <h2>List down html formatting elements?</h2>
            <p>
                <ul type="circles">
                    <li>&lt;b&gt;  - Bold text</li>
                    <li>&lt;i&gt;  - Italic text</li>
                    <li>&lt;strong&gt;  - Important text</li>
                    <li>&lt;sub&gt;  - Subscript text</li>
                    <li>&lt;sup&gt;  - Superscript text</li>
                    <li>&lt;small&gt;  - Smaller text</li>
                    
                </ul>
            </p>
